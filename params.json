It can be run with three options. Run it as \r\n   \r\n      nw_topo.py --help\r\n      \r\n   to get a list of options.\r\n   \r\n   ISO_DIR is the place where you must put your ISO files and VMDK files if necessary for the VM to boot. The tool\r\n   loads these ISO files and creates either a blank disk image or a copy of the VMDK file you have specified, in                                    the working directory, which is './working_dir'.\r\n   \r\n   The ISO files must be named as the version of the VM. For example a VM with version of 'ubuntu_15' will have an\r\n   ISO called 'ubuntu_15.iso' in the ISO_DIR. The same goes for VMDK files.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
